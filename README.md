# Yahtzee #

## Explanation

The dice game Yahtzee is known worldwide and is also extremely popular in our country. The game is played with five dice and scoring pad, where it is also a very compact game. Each participant may roll the dice three times on each turn. The aim is to achieve the highest possible score, which can then be written down on the score block.

On the first two throws, the contestant may put his stones aside and throw the remaining dice. However, after the third throw the score is fixed and that is no longer possible. Combinations must always be taken from the score block. It is of course also a possibility that the desired combination will already be achieved on the first throw. It is not mandatory to roll the dice three times.
## Yahztee Bonus
The highest combination is Yahtzee, which is five of the same numbers. It is possible that a Yahtzee will be thrown several times during the game. In that case, the player who managed to achieve this score first will receive 100 bonus points each time. Unless it has been agreed in advance that it will not be played that way. If you throw Yahtzee more than once, this score may also be crossed off as another combination.
